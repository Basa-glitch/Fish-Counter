# Fish-Counter
The main files to prioritize in this project are:
- WeightsAndBiases.py helps train the model and this is how I was able to obtain high confidenece score during the training process.
- PlottingPoints.py is how I was able to create and plot lines in opencv for the line counter.
- CheckingCamera.py is to check that the camera you have plugged can be opened.
- Final.py is the file I use to run my code for the whole project
All these other files you see before are just tests I've done that sadly didn't meet my expectations so I kept them there in case anyone's interested in seeing what these are
